# **Task 2 Exploratory Data Analysis**

1. Loading, and Inspecting the Data
Read the Titanic dataset in CSV format with the help of Pandas.

Studied basic information with the help of .head() and .info() and .describe() functions.

2. Data Cleaning
Treated missing data:

Replaced any missing Age data with median age.

Studied Embarked and replaced missing data by the mode of port (mode()).

If any Cabin entries were marked as missing, assigned it as Unknown.

3. Descriptive Statistics
Created descriptive summary statistics to numerical and categorical columns.

Found distributions, outliers, and skew in such characteristics as Fare, Age, etc.

4. Data Visualization
Numerical features such as Age and Fare were recorded in the form of histograms.

Boxplots were used to identify outliers as well as to compare age distributions between the categories of survival.

Survival distributions explained by countplots were given in classes and gender wise.

Correlation Heatmap revealed their connection with numeric features.
